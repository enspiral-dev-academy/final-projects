### [Be Seasonable](https://beseasonable.com/)

Be Seasonable is an app that helps people make sustainable food choices by making it easy to see what is in season, at low prices and other ethical concerns. Be Seasonable is a free website that tells you what produce is currently in season, the average monthly cost based on the Statistics NZ Food Price Index, and any ethical warnings we've identified for that produce.

It does this by combining the average monthly costs of in-season produce with research into the environmental and ethical impacts of production.

### [TakeMe](https://take-me-nz.herokuapp.com)

This is a web app for listing items that you no longer want or need, but could still have value or use to someone else. The focus is on recycling, preventing both waste and further unnecessary production, with a side effect of saving you money!

### [Trial by Seven](https://the-name-of-the-game.herokuapp.com/)

Tales grow tall and tempers short when ale flows freely. After the dust clears only two things remain - a noble corpse and the thirst for justice.\
Duty dictated that you and your companion stand as part of Five Champions sworn to defend the honour of their lord.\
Cruel fate, that it be on opposing sides of the field...
